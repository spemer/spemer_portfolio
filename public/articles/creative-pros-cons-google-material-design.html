              <h2>Does Material Design make designers ‘non-creative’?</h2>
              <p>
                In 2014, Google announced <b>‘Material Design’</b> at Google I/O
                2014. It’s a design-concept for Android and it’s devices. It is
                clean and intuitive. Most of Google apps such as Gmail, YouTube,
                Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Docs, Google Plus — applied
                this design language since 2015. It makes <b>unity</b> through
                overall applications.

              <div class="hrline"></div>
              <p>
                It’s based on <b>physical theories</b> in our real-life, So it
                looks natural and more realistic than usual flat-design
                interfaces. It presents bunch of guidelines, patterns, icons and
                furthermore, color palettes called ‘Material Palette’. What
                designers have to do is just following the strict guidelines,
                mix and match the ‘material’ components, place layouts.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Then, what’s the problem? Google already offers plenty of design
                elements for Material Design such as style, motion, patterns.
                <b>Paradoxically,</b> those well-detailed guidelines are the
                most critical problems for us — More specifically, Interface
                designers.

                Exactly, Material design is good to use. It’s clean. It’s
                intuitive. It covers overall Android devices. The problem is,
                Designers to much used to rely on this guidelines. There are
                lots of Android mobile applications designed on the guidelines
                of Material Design. Still, It is one of the most detailed and
                usable design concept, but the applications that designed by
                Material Design’s guidelines are look so same like
                <b>factory-produced</b> design.

                Material Design, made by Google, and deeply involved with Google
                —may causes the <b>lack of individuality.</b> Lots of Android
                applications on Google Play Store look not so different. Sure,
                they conforming the Material guidelines. And at the same time,
                It kills the creativity of designer. <b>Why?</b>
              </p>

              <div class="hrline"></div>

              <p>
                As I told you before, there are tons of different Android
                applications on Google Play Store. They have their own purposes,
                unique experiences, different categories and special
                necessities. The problem is on their <b>appearance</b> — well
                following the guidelines of Material Design.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Lots of designers are now using <b>same UI components</b> of
                Material Design. They are applying similar layouts documented by
                Material Design on their different applications. Irrelevant
                colors on apps or same colors are painted on different
                applications. Material icons are pretty nice, but we can make it
                more unique or optimizing for it’s own environment.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                There are lots of free Material UI kits starred by thousands of
                designers. You can find lots of Material Design samples on
                <b>Dribbble or Google,</b> while searching ‘Android’ or
                ‘Material’ and scrolling some pixels.

                Material Design rules every details from A to Z. It loved by
                lots of designers due to it’s great system. We all know it’s
                well designed, easy to use and understandable design guideline.
                We can still follow the guidelines of Material Design, But not
                100%. Each applications have their own purposes. When we
                following the usability, appearance can’t be fit perfectly on
                just <b>Single guideline — Material Design.</b> We must optimize
                with the best guidelines for each application’s individuality.
                <br /><br />
                We can maintain some <b>basic theories</b> of Material Design
                like depth of components, physical principles and lightning
                interests. And on those some basic guidelines, We can create
                more valuable and concrete experiences and interface designs.
                <br /><br />
                We can customize our application’s fonts, icons, colors and
                components
                <b>without fully following Material Design’s guidelines.</b>
                Creativity is the most important part of designer. Although the
                Material Design is one of the most well organized guidelines, We
                still have a duty to develop, customize, optimize and design at
                the front-line of it’s trend as a UI designers. Use it
                appropriately, But do not fully rely on it.
