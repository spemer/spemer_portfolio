			<h3>Inspiration</h3>
				<p>
					Lots of teens using SNS applications nowadays. They love to use SNS applications like <b>Twitter, Facebook and Instagram</b>. And they really care about their account’s popularity and interest about their account from others. Most of the teens that using SNS believe about ripple effects from their SNS account, and they spend a lot of time to attract more followers on their account.
				</p>

			<div class="hrline"></div>

			<h3>Design Process</h3>
				<p>
					I followed IDEO’s <b><a href="https://www.usertesting.com/blog/2015/07/09/how-ideo-uses-customer-insights-to-design-innovative-products-users-love/" target="_blank" data-balloon-pos="down" data-balloon="Article about IDEO's HCD(New tab)"><span class="underline">Human-Centered Design</span></a></b> process to make my design backed up by feedback, researches and user testing.

			<h3>#1. Observation</h3>
				<h4>Goal &amp; Audience</h4>
				<p>
					IGTracker’s goal is very straightforward and simple — To analyze and track user’s Instagram account’s statistics like Followers, Following, Likes, Comments, etc. Our main target are <b>teens</b>, mostly from <b>USA</b> and aged between <b>13~25</b>. Also main audience of Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook. Above all, <b>Instagram</b> is the most popular and active application between those targets. We aim our targets by providing an application, which can deeply analyzing their Instagram account’s statistics.

			<h4>Results of surveys by LendEDU</h4>
				<p>
					<b>Question 1</b>: Do you make an intentional effort to like people’s Instagram posts who like yours?
				</p>

					<b>Question 2</b>: Do you know someone who deletes Facebook or Instagram posts if they don’t get enough likes?
				</p>

				<p>
					According to the survey by LendEDU above, it seems most of young people really cares about their <b>Instagram account's popularity</b>. We can find out that those Instagram users check the popularity of posts they posted. They are accustomed to do such 'work'. However, what if they can check and review their accounts <b>overall history of statistics on a single screen</b>, instead of checking their posts one by one?

			<h3>#2. Ideation</h3>
				<h4>Main purpose</h4>
				<p>
					IGTracker’s main purpose is to <b>provide insights</b> of user’s Instagram account. IGTracker analyze the account’s status like it’s Followers, Blocked users, Comments and likes. And show those information with <b>graph and chart</b> with clean and intuitive user interface.
				</p>

				<br>

			<h4>Brainstorming</h4>
				<p>
					Our team began to brainstorming the ideas, based on observations and experiences on prior step. We focused on our target’s <b>needs and desires</b>. There are some points on our main targets(<b>Teens based in USA, aged between 13~25</b>):
				</p>

				<ol class="textbox-colored">
					<li>
					They are used to making <b>social networks</b> with mobile applications like Snapchat, Instagram, Musical.ly and Houseparty.
					</li>

					<li>
					They love <b>interactions and gestures</b> like Swiping, Pinching, Expanding, Animations and those are completely natural to them.
					</li>

					<li>
					They are <b>expert</b> on those operation system, applications and interactions, but still don’t want to be difficult by complex and hard UX.
					</li>
				</ol>

			<h4>Quick UI Concepts</h4>
				<p>
					IGTracker is going to release only for <b>iOS platform</b>. Based on iOS Human Interface Guidelines, our team started to make some guidelines for IGTracker application:


				<ol class="textbox-colored">
					<li>
					<b>White/negative</b> space clean design, with <b>bold fonts</b> and <b>emoji</b>(Inspired by Snapchat).
					</li>

					<li>
					<b>Organized, spaced</b> and <b>easy to read</b> with contrast colors, with the <b>minimalist</b> approach for readable data and graph at a glance.
					</li>

					<li>
					Focus on <b>young designs</b> and not only functional design due to our main targets have <b>standards</b> from other applications like Instagram, Snapchat or Facebook.
					</li>
				</ol>

			<h3 id="anchor3">#3. Rapid Prototyping</h3>
				<h4>Lo-Fi Prototypes</h4>

				<p>
				For a <b>quick user testing</b>, our team created some rough prototypes. With InVision application, made them clickable, and started to test it with some testers who love to use Instagram, and <b>care about their popularity</b>. To make sure that our solution is on our target, we focused not to make a detailed and perfect solution and prototypes. (Click image to enlarge <i class="fa fa-expand" aria-hidden="true"></i>)
				</p>

			<figure class="articleImg articleFig articleImgSize">
				<section data-featherlight-gallery data-featherlight-filter="a" data-featherlight="image">
				<a class="feather" href="/img/works/igtracker/lofi.png">
					<img loading="lazy" src="/img/works/igtracker/lofi.png" alt="Lo-Fi Prototype" data-balloon-pos="down" data-balloon="Lo-Fi Prototype" />

						a. Dashboard -> b. Audience/Posts -> c. Inner Analytics
					</figcaption>
				</a>
				</section>
			</figure>

				<br>

			<h4>_a. Dashboard</h4>
				<p>
					After the user logs in, this screen is the first screen that user see. In this screen, we <b>summarize</b> the main information that the user needs by graphs:
				</p>

				<ul class="textbox-colored">
					<li>Followers Growth</li>
					<li>Unfollowed Me</li>
					<li>Not Following Me Back</li>
					<li>Blocked Me</li>
					<li>Deleted Comments/Likes</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					It’s not a scrollable screen. We are showing <b>fixed number</b> of mandatory items, to give the user the feel of control on what’s happening with user’s account analytics, on a <b>high level</b>.
				</p>
			<br>
				<p>
					For the very first time, we had more graphs on the main screen for more insight than the current design. However, after thinking carefully about what really users need, we decided to offer only 5 graphs in total: '<b>Followers Growth</b>', '<b>Unfollowed Me</b>', '<b>Not Following Me Back</b>', '<b>Blocked Me</b>' and '<b>Deleted Comments/Likes</b>'.
				</p>

		<div class="textbox-colored">
			<h6>1. Followers Growth</h6>
				<p>
					The number of followers that are heavily exposed at the top of their Instagram profile is the indicator for them that <b>indicates their popularity on the Instagram</b>. They are very interested in the number of their followers and are sensitive to changes of the numbers. In the '<b>Followers Growth</b>' graph, you can see at a glance statistics about the overall followers change of the Instagram account.
				</p>
				<br>

			<h6>2. Unfollowed Me</h6>
				<p>
					It's an interesting phenomenon, but people really want to know about other people who <b>no longer follow their Instagram account</b>. They feel that their Instagram account is popular when there are many people who follow their account than they follow, and feel satisfied about that. Therefore, they want to find unfollowed users and unfollow them equally. The '<b>Unfollowed Me</b>' graph provides insight into those statistics.
				</p>
				<br>

			<h6>3. Not Following Me Back</h6>
				<p>
					This is similar to let the '<b>Unfollowed Me</b>' graph on the main screen. When they follow someone, they want him/her to <b>follows them back</b>. The number of followers is very important to them. If someone does not follow me back, they will want to know who it is.
				</p>
				<br>

			<h6>4. Blocked Me</h6>
				<p>
					It is the worst situation. Instagram does not tell users <b>who blocked them</b>. Everyone on Instagram wants to know <b>how many people have blocked them</b>, and <b>who has blocked them</b>.
				</p>
				<br>

			<h6>5. Deleted Comments/Likes</h6>
				<p>
					As you can see from the statistics above, the popularity of your post is very important to them. They want to delete posts that do not get satisfactory 'Likes' and 'Comments'. The '<b>Deleted Comments/Likes</b>' graph shows at a glance the number of posts that have <b>not received satisfactory 'Likes' and 'Comments'</b> and number of deleted Comments / Likes.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h4>_b. Audience/Posts Screen</h4>

				<p>
					This screen will have a list of ‘<b>insights</b>’ and ‘<b>analytics</b>’ about the ‘<b>Tab</b>’ that the user just tapped (either ‘<b>Posts</b>’ or ‘<b>Audience</b>’) that the user can access. It’s basically a scroll view that shows the available data options we provide. User can switch to this screen using the <b>Tab Bar</b>, clicking ‘<b>Posts</b>’ or ‘<b>Audience</b>’ tab (both are same screen, only with different data). When pressing one of the actions(<b>tab</b>), it’ll take him to the next screen (<b>c.</b>) in our list.
				</p>

				<br>
			<h4>_c. Inner Analytics Screen</h4>
				<p>
					This screen will display the information that user just tapped on prior screen (<b>b.</b>). It’s basically a scroll view that shows a list of the requested information by the user. On this screen, each user profile list contains:
				</p>

				<ul class="textbox-colored">
					<li>Name of the user</li>
					<li>If the user follows me or not</li>
					<li>The amount of the likes &amp; comments user gave me</li>
				</ul>

		<div class="hrline"></div>

		<div class="colorBox"></div>
			<h3>#4. User Feedback</h3>
				<h4>Usability Testing</h4>
				<p>
					With the prototypes we created on prior step (<b><a data-scroll href="#anchor3"><span class="underline">#3.</span></a></b>), our team had some usability tests with numerous testers. There’s only one condition for testers — love Instagram and spend a lot of time to manage their account on Instagram. This step is critical for us to get more <b>ideas, feedback and information</b> and to better understand the <b>target’s needs</b>.

			<h4>Feedback</h4>
				<p>
					We got some feedback from users during the usability testing. Here’re the lists that we summarized from main feedback.
				</p>

				<ol class="textbox-colored">
					<li>
					Need ‘<b>Switch Account</b>’ button on Dashboard Screen for users who have more than just one account.
					</li>

					<li>
					Screens are pretty ‘<b>businesslike</b>’ and boring; in spite of the main targets are teenagers.
					</il>

					<li>
					‘<b>Follow</b>’/’<b>Unfollow</b>’ button is needed on ‘<b>Inner Analytics Screen</b>’ to make user able to follow or unfollow other users immediately.
					</li>
				</ol>

			<div class="hrline"></div>

			<h4>Improvements</h4>
				<p>
					Based on tester’s feedback and opinions, some features are re-designed with Hi-Fi prototypes. (Click image to enlarge <i class="fa fa-expand" aria-hidden="true"></i>)

			<br>
			<h4>_a. Dashboard</h4>
				<p>
					We added ‘<b>Switch Account</b>’ button on top of the screen for users to switch their accounts if they have more than 1 account. It’s similar with Instagram application — just click and tab another account to switch — so the users can use this feature easily. If the user wants to add a new account, simply tab the last list of the menu ‘<b>Add Account</b>’.

					No big change has happened. Just organized each tabs (lists), added some details like arrow and font variation.
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>
				<h4>_c. Inner Analytics Screen</h4>
				<p>
					‘<b>Follow</b>’ and ‘<b>Unfollow</b>’ buttons were added on the right side of each user’s list to make user follow or unfollow the other users on this screen, <b>without exit the IGTracker application</b>. We also added more details like numbers of follow and followers of users in the list.

			<h3>What I've learnt</h3>
				<p>
					The targets of IGTracker are 'Teens' and 'College students'. We interviewed them (including our friends), observed them, looked at surveys about their use of Instagram, and spent a lot of time thinking about <b>what they really needed</b> in managing their Instagram account. Through observing the actual users and empathizing with them, we felt the <b>importance of insight</b> that they could gain. In addition, found the insight can make the product <b>useful and good to use</b>.

			<h3>Takeaways</h3>
				<p>
					IGTracker is an application for teens in USA who love using SNS applications and spend time with them. Our application will help them to easily get insight about their account’s <b>statistics and interests</b> with clean and detailed user interface.
